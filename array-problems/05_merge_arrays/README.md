# Merge Two Arrays

## Problem
Write a Java program to merge two arrays into a single array.

## Example
Input:
Array A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Array B = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Output:
Merged array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

## Approach
1. Declare and initialize two arrays.  
2. Create a new array with length = length of array A + length of array B.  
3. Use a loop to copy elements from array A and B into the new array.  
4. Print the merged array.  

## Solution
See `solution.java` for implementation.
