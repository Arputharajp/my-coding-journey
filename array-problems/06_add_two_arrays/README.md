# Add Two Arrays Element-wise

## Problem
Write a Java program to add two arrays element by element and store the result in a new array.

## Example
Input: 
Array A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Array B = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Output:
Result array: 7 9 11 13 15
## Approach
1. Declare and initialize two arrays of the same length.  
2. Create a new array of the same length to store the sum.  
3. Use a loop to iterate through the arrays and add corresponding elements.  
4. Print the resulting array.  

## Solution
See `solution.java` for implementation.
