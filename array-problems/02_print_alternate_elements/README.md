# Print Alternate Elements

## Problem
Write a Java program to print every alternate element in an array.

## Example
Input: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
Output: 
Alternate elements: 1 3 5
## Approach
1. Declare and initialize the array.  
2. Use a loop to iterate through the array with a step of 2.  
3. Print the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, â€¦).

## Solution
See `solution.java` for implementation.
