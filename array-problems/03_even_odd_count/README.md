# Count Even and Odd Numbers

## Problem
Write a Java program to count the number of even and odd elements in an array.

## Example
Input: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
Output: 
Even count: 2
Odd count: 3
## Approach
1. Declare and initialize the array.  
2. Use a loop to iterate through each element.  
3. Use modulo operator (`%`) to check if the element is even or odd.  
4. Maintain separate counters for even and odd numbers.  

## Solution
See `solution.java` for implementation.
