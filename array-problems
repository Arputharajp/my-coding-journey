# My Coding Journey

Welcome to my coding journey! ðŸš€  
This repository is where I document my learning progress, practice problems, mini-projects, and experiments as I grow my programming skills.

## About

- Learning programming step by step.
- Practicing coding problems and algorithms.
- Building small projects to understand real-world applications.
- Exploring different programming languages and concepts.

## Array Problems

Here are my array problem solutions in Java:

1. [Array Length and Values](array-problems/01_array_length_and_values) â€“ Find the length of an array and print its elements.  
2. [Print Alternate Elements](array-problems/02_print_alternate_elements) â€“ Print every alternate element in an array.  
3. [Count Even and Odd Numbers](array-problems/03_even_odd_count) â€“ Count the number of even and odd elements in an array.  
4. [Check if Array is Sorted](array-problems/04_sorted_array_check) â€“ Check if an array is sorted in ascending order.  
5. [Merge Two Arrays](array-problems/05_merge_arrays) â€“ Merge two arrays into a single array.  
6. [Merge Two Arrays](array-problems/06_merge_arrays) â€“ Merge two arrays into a single array.  
7. [Find Second Largest Element](array-problems/07_second_largest) â€“ Find the second largest element in an array.  
8. [Right Shift Array](array-problems/08_right_shift) â€“ Right shift all elements of an array by one position.  
9. [Left Shift Array](array-problems/09_left_shift) â€“ Left shift all elements of an array by one position.  
10. [Copy Array](array-problems/10_copy_array) â€“ Copy all elements of an array into a new array.
