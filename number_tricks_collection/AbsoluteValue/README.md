# Absolute Value Finder

This Java program finds the **absolute value** of a given number using the built-in `Math.abs()` method.

## How It Works

- The program reads a number from the user.
- `Math.abs(num)` returns the non-negative value of the number.
- The result is printed to the console.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac AbsoluteValue.java
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
java AbsoluteValue
Enter a number and see its absolute value.

Example
css
Copy code
Enter a number to find its absolute value: -15
Absolute value: 15
css
Copy code
Enter a number to find its absolute value: 27
