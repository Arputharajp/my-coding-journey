# Odd or Even Checker using Ternary Operator

This is a simple Java program to check whether a number is **odd or even** using the **ternary operator**.

## How It Works

- The program reads a number from the user.
- It uses the ternary operator to check divisibility by 2:
  ```java
  String result = (num % 2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
If the number is divisible by 2, it prints Even; otherwise, it prints Odd.

How to Run
Make sure you have Java installed.

Compile the program:

bash
Copy code
javac OddEvenTernary.java
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
java OddEvenTernary
Enter a number when prompted and see the result.

Example
yaml
Copy code
Enter a number: 7
The number is: Odd
yaml
Copy code
Enter a number: 12
The number is: Even
